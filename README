This program finds keys that share common factors in a given list of 1024 bit
public keys. Once it finds these common keys, it finds the associated private
keys for the matching public keys and writes them to a file called privateKeys.

There are multiple versions of the file that can be compiled separately using
the packaged Makefile

make cuda -- compiles the version of the program that runs with cuda on the gpu
   Creates the file rsa_cuda

make cpu -- compiles the version of the program that runs on the cpu and finds
   GCDs using binary division. Creates the file rsa_cpu

make cpu_gmp -- compiles the version of the program that runs on the cpu and
   finds GCDs using the gmp library. Creates the file rsa_cpu

Usage: ./<executable name> <file containing public keys>

The program will output information during runtime of how many keys are in the
file, as well as which line numbers contain keys with common prime factors.
